"The R Object File Format is supported for write access, and limited read "
"access by GDAL. This format is the native format R uses for objects saved "
"with the *save* command and loaded with the *load* command. GDAL supports "
"writing a dataset as an array object in this format, and supports reading "
"files with simple rasters in essentially the same organization. It will not "
"read most R object files."
