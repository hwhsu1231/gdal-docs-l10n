"This driver provides the capability to read TerraSAR-X complex data. While "
"most users will receive products in GeoTIFF format (representing detected "
"radiation reflected from the targets, or geocoded data), ScanSAR products "
"will be distributed in COSAR format."

"Essentially, COSAR is an annotated binary matrix, with each sample held in 4 "
"bytes (16 bits real, 16 bits imaginary) stored with the most significant "
"byte first (Big Endian). Within a COSAR container there are one or more "
"\"bursts\" which represent individual ScanSAR bursts. Note that if a "
"Stripmap or Spotlight product is held in a COSAR container it is stored in a "
"single burst."
