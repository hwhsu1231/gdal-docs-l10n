"MS Windows Device Independent Bitmaps supported by the Windows kernel and "
"mostly used for storing system decoration images. Due to the nature of the "
"BMP format it has several restrictions and could not be used for general "
"image storing. In particular, you can create only 1-bit monochrome, 8-bit "
"pseudocoloured and 24-bit RGB images only. Even grayscale images must be "
"saved in pseudocolour form."
