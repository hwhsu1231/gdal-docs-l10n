"GDAL does read the map extents (geotransform) from LAN/GIS files, and "
"attempts to read the coordinate system information. However, this format of "
"file does not include complete coordinate system information, so for state "
"plane and UTM coordinate systems a LOCAL_CS definition is returned with "
"valid linear units but no other meaningful information."
