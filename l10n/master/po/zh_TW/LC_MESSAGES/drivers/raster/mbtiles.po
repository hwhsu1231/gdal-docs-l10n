"Technical/implementation note: in the general case, GDAL blocks do not "
"exactly match a single MBTiles tile. In which case, each GDAL block will "
"overlap four MBTiles tiles. This is easily handled on the read side, but on "
"creation/update side, such configuration could cause numerous decompression/ "
"recompression of tiles to be done, which might cause unnecessary quality "
"loss when using lossy compression (JPEG). To avoid that, the driver will "
"create a temporary database next to the main MBTiles file to store partial "
"MBTiles tiles in a lossless (and uncompressed) way. Once a tile has received "
"data for its four quadrants and for all the bands (or the dataset is closed "
"or explicitly flushed with FlushCache()), those uncompressed tiles are "
"definitely transferred to the MBTiles file with the appropriate compression. "

"(note however than when zooming in, this can cause non desirable visual "
"artifacts). Setting it to YES will generally cause less effective "
"compression. Note that at that time, such an 8-bit PNG formulation is only "
"used for fully opaque tiles, as the median-cut algorithm currently "
"implemented to compute the optimal color table does not support alpha "
"channel (even if PNG8 format would potentially allow color table with "
