"for nearest resampling, for each target pixel, one of the potential "
"contributing source pixels is selected (in an implementation specific way). "
"Its value is used as it, be it valid or invalid."

"for bilinear, cubic, cubicspline and lanczos, for each target pixel, the "
"weights of contributing source pixels is set to zero to ignore them when "
"they are masked. There is an extra specificity for cubic: given that some of "
"the weights in the kernel are negative, such strategy could lead to strong "
"overshoot/undershoot when there is an alternance of valid and invalid "
"pixels. Consequently, if any of the horizontal or vertical direction, if the "
"maximum number of valid source pixels in each dimension is less than the "
"radius of the resampling kernel, the target pixel is considered as nodata."

"for the other resampling methods, source pixels contributing to the target "
"pixel are ignored if masked. Only the valid ones are taken into account. If "
"there are none, the target pixel is considered as nodata."
