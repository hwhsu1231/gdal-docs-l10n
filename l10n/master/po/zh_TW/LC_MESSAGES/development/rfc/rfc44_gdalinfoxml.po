"ogrinfo and gdalinfo are incredibly useful metadata gathering tools. Their "
"native text-based output formats, however, are not easily parseable by "
"common external tools. Both XML and JSON are easily parsed and adding those "
"output formats would substantially increase the utility for those looking to "
"add the ogrinfo and gdalinfo utilities to a scripting stack."

"To add the XML output to each utility will require \"breaking up\" the main "
