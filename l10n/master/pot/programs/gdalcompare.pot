"The :program:`gdalcompare.py` script compares two GDAL supported datasets "

"standard output the script will also return the difference count in its exit "

"Image pixels, and various metadata are checked. There is also a byte by byte "
"comparison done which will count as one difference. So if it is only "
"important that the GDAL visible data is identical a difference count of 1 "
"(the binary difference) should be considered acceptable."

"Note that the :program:`gdalcompare.py` script (like all the other scripts) "

"returns a difference count (excluding the binary comparison). The "
"`gdalcompare.compare_sds()` entry point can be used to compare subdatasets."
