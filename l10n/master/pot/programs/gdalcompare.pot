":program:`gdalcompare` compares two GDAL supported datasets and reports the "

"Image pixels, and various metadata are checked. There is also a byte by byte "
"comparison done which will count as one difference. So if it is only "
"important that the GDAL visible data is identical a difference count of 1 "

"Note that the :program:`gdalcompare` script (like all the other scripts) can "

"returns a difference count (excluding the binary comparison). The "
"`gdalcompare.compare_sds()` entry point can be used to compare subdatasets."
