"This RFC defines new function for each GDAL utility. The new utility "
"functions can be used to work on in-memory datasets. The utility code is "
"modified to call the new function. This RFC gives a general frame and "
"principles, demonstrated with gdalinfo, but aimed at being extended with "
"other utilities."

"modified to take into account the new lib. The GDAL utilities are modified "
"to use the new functions. New header file gdal_utils.h is created which "
