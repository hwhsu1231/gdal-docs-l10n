"This RFC aims at adding the capability of specifying sub-types to OGR "
"fields, like boolean, 16 bit integers or 32 bit floating point values. The "
"sub-type of a field definition is an additional attribute that specifies a "
"hint or a restriction to the main type. The subtype can be used by "
"applications and drivers that know how to handle it, and can generally be "
"safely ignored by applications and drivers that do not."
