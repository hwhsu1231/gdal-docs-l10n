"By default, the datatype returned for GRASS ASCII grid datasets by GDAL is "
"autodetected, and set to Float32 for grid with floating point values or "
"Int32 otherwise. This is done by analysing the format of the null value and "
"the first 100k bytes of data of the grid. You can also explicitly specify "
"the datatype by setting the GRASSASCIIGRID_DATATYPE configuration option "
"(Int32, Float32 and Float64 values are supported currently)"
