"GDAL supports some variations of raw raster files with associated ENVI "
"style .hdr files describing the format. To select an existing ENVI raster "
"file select the binary file containing the data (as opposed to the .hdr "
"file), and GDAL will find the .hdr file by replacing the dataset extension "
"with .hdr."

"GDAL should support reading bil, bip and bsq interleaved formats, and most "
"pixel types are supported, including 8bit unsigned, 16 and 32bit signed and "
"unsigned integers, 32bit and 64 bit floating point, and 32bit and 64bit "
"complex floating point. There is limited support for recognising map_info "
"keywords with the coordinate system and georeferencing. In particular, UTM "
"and State Plane should work."
