"The driver supports both reading and writing (including create, delete, and "
"copy) SAGA GIS binary grids. SAGA binary grid datasets are made of an ASCII "
"header (.SGRD) and a binary data (.SDAT) file with a common basename. The ."
"SDAT file should be selected to access the dataset. Starting with GDAL 2.3, "
"the driver can read compressed .sg-grd-z files that are ZIP archives with ."
"sgrd, .sdat and .prj files."
