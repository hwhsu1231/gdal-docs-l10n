"HF2 is a heightfield format that records difference between consecutive cell "
"values. HF2 files can also optionally be compressed by the gzip algorithm, "
"and so the HF2.GZ files (or HFZ, equivalently) may be significantly smaller "
"than the uncompressed data. The file format enables the user to have control "
"on the desired accuracy through the vertical precision parameter."
