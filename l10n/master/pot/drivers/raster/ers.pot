"GDAL supports reading and writing raster files with .ers header files, with "
"some limitations. The .ers ascii format is used by ERMapper for labeling raw "
"data files, as well as for providing extended metadata, and georeferencing "
"for some other file formats. The .ERS format, or variants are also used to "
"hold descriptions of ERMapper algorithms, but these are not supported by "
"GDAL."
