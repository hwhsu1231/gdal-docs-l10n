"Supported by GDAL for read access. This format is the internal binary format "
"for Arc/Info Grid, and takes the form of a coverage level directory in an "
"Arc/Info database. To open the coverage select the coverage directory, or "
"an .adf file (such as hdr.adf) from within it. If the directory does not "
"contain file(s) with names like w001001.adf then it is not a grid coverage."
