"GDAL has limited support for reading NLAPS Data Format files. This is a "
"format primarily used by the Eros Data Center for distribution of Landsat "
"data. NDF datasets consist of a header file (often with the extension .H1) "
"and one or more associated raw data files (often .I1, .I2, ...). To open a "
"dataset select the header file, often with the extension .H1, .H2 or .HD."
