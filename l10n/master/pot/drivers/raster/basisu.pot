"Basis Universal is a \"supercompressed\" GPU texture data interchange system "
"that supports two highly compressed intermediate file formats (.basis or "
"the .KTX2 open standard from the Khronos Group) that can be quickly "
"transcoded to a very wide variety of GPU compressed and uncompressed pixel "
"formats."

"The format supports 2 modes: a high quality mode which is internally based "

"quality mode which is based off a subset of ETC1 called \"ETC1S\". The "
"default is ETC1S. Only input of type Byte and with 1 (grey), 2 (grey+alpha), "
"3 (RGB) or 4 (RGB + alpha) bands is supported. Refer to https://github.com/"
